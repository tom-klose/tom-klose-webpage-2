Recently, I found myself in a post-lunch conversation on the merits and hardships of life inside academia. 

One particular comment resonated with me: A colleague said that she deems it important to recognise the <i> people </i> 
behind the professionals that we work and dine with during the day.

That said, this page is dedicated to the things that I cherish beside mathematics. I hope you will enjoy what you see and read.
