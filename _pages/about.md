Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of <a href="https://giuseppecannizzaro.weebly.com">Giuseppe Cannizzaro</a> at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom. Before that, I completed my doctorate at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~friz/">Peter K. Friz</a>. I was also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.





My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, in particular (singular) stochastic partial differential equations.
