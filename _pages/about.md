Hi! I'm Tom, a Research Assistant and PhD student at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany, supervised by Peter K. Friz. I am also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.

My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, in particular (singular) stochastic partial differential equations. You can find my work here:

<ul>
  <li> Precise Laplace asymptotics for singular stochastic PDEs: The case of 2D gPAM (joint with Peter K. Friz), [arXiv:2103.00028 [math.PR]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00028.pdf) </li>
  <li> Together with Pavlos Tsatsoulis (MPI Leipzig), I aim to establish exponential loss of memory for the 3D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation in the small noise regime. Test</li>
</ul>
