Hi! I'm Tom, a Research Assistant and PhD student at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany, supervised by Peter K. Friz. I am also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.

My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, in particular (singular) stochastic partial differential equations. You can find my work here:

<ul>
  <li> The constant coefficient in precise Laplace asymptotics for gPAM, under review, Preprint available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03358.pdf"> arXiv:2202.03358 [math.PR] </a></li>
  <li> Precise Laplace asymptotics for singular stochastic PDEs: The case of 2D gPAM (joint with Peter K. Friz), accepted for publication in <i> Journal of Functional Analysis</i>, Preprint available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00028.pdf"> arXiv:2103.00028 [math.PR] </a> </li>
