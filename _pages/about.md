Welcome to my website! My name is Tom and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Giuseppe Cannizzaro at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom. Before that, I completed my doctorate at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany, under the supervision of Peter K. Friz. I was also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.

My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, in particular (singular) stochastic partial differential equations.
