Hi! I'm Tom, a Research Assistant and PhD student at Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany, supervised by Peter K. Friz. I am also a fellow of the Berlin Mathematical School.

My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, in particular (singular) stochastic partial differential equations. At the moment, I am focussing on two projects:

<ul>
  <li> I am about to finish a paper on precise Laplace asymptotics for the non-linear 2D Parabolic Anderson Model using Hairer's regularity structures (joint with Peter K. Friz). </li>
  <li> Together with Pavlos Tsatsoulis (MPI Leipzig), I aim to establish exponential loss of memory for the 3D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation in the small noise regime. </li>
</ul>
